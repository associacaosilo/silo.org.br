Is an immersion for research and artistic experimentation in an Atlantic Rainforest reserve, aimed at artists and curators, with the participation of scientists and rural communities. The residency offers a territorial experience which differs from urban living, via artistic creation, while creating narratives about the current rural/environmental universe by means of the Arts.
