Every year we organise a laboratory for the development of collaborative open source projects, thereby promoting the learning and exchange of knowledge horizontally and experientially, based on the demands of the projects themselves. Our laboratory produces different types of technologies, either linked to the technical or the social realm, taking in areas as diverse as engineering, economics, social sciences, art, education, among many others. Moreover, we offer mentorship and assistance programmes to replicate the methodology we use in other contexts.
