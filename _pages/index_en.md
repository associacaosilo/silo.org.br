**Silo – Art and Rural Latitude** is a non profit organization dedicated to create and promote Art, Science and Technology in rural, peripheral and environmental protection areas, stimulating exchange between intuitive techniques and scientific knowledge. Silo works through immersive experiences, transdisciplinary and collaborative practices.

We are currently based in Serrinha do Alambari, an APA (Environmental Protection Area), located in the Mantiqueira Mountain Range on the triple border between the states of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and São Paulo. Our activities encompass local and international communities.Women primarily run our team and we are committed to race and gender equality.
