We are very happy to inform you that we have successfully ended the [crowdfund campaign](https://benfeitoria.com/siloescola) for the renovation of Silo Escola! 

We are immensely grateful to everyone who participated, donated and helped us spread the word. Each gesture was extremely important to reach our goal.

We achieved the  1st goal and, with the final fund of R$78,565.00, we will be able to renovate the shed's roof and start repairs on the bathroom.

But there is still a lot to be done!

If you want to collaborate, you can still donate to Silo!
