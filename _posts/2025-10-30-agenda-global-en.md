**Silo – Art and Rural Latitude promotes socio-environmental initiatives that directly engage with the themes to be discussed at COP30.**

COP30, which will take place from November 10 to 21 in Belém, Brazil, aims to build, through consensus, measures for mitigating and adapting to climate change, amid growing concern over global warming and the need to promote socio-environmental justice in this context.

For the first time, Brazil will host a Climate Conference. The COP (Conference of the Parties) is made up of 196 member countries that jointly define strategies and actions to limit climate change and promote a fair adaptation of society to this new scenario. To achieve this, dialogue among these nations is essential in order to reach agreements.

For eight years, Silo – Art and Rural Latitude has been working in support of these agendas, promoting initiatives that connect art, science, technology, and rural knowledge to confront the challenges of the climate crisis and socio-environmental issues, from the perspective of the interweaving between the local and the global.

**The Good Life**

Silo promotes actions and reflections that recognize the scientific knowledge and traditional ways of life of rural communities, Indigenous peoples, and quilombola communities, who are the true guardians of our country’s biodiversity. Its work is guided by the understanding that collective well-being must prevail over individualism and the logic of material accumulation — the very principles that drive the climate crisis.

**Technology for the Benefit of Society**

Silo invests in technologies aimed at local benefit and family farming, seeking to question uses that reproduce inequalities and to propose alternatives that foster social justice, environmental monitoring, and the strengthening of networks at different scales.

**Strengthening Communities and Territories**

Silo develops laboratories with its own methodologies that empower peripheral territories by training people and supporting projects committed to sustainability. It believes that social and collaborative participation, citizen-generated data, and citizen science can equip people and territories with autonomy and resilience.

**The Responsible Use of Conservation Units**

Based in an Environmental Protection Area, Silo works to raise community awareness about sustainable ways of life and management in such territories. By promoting dialogue among communities, scientists, and specialists, the organization strengthens environmental protection policies and encourages everyday practices that make these policies effective.

**Imagining Better Futures**

All of Silo’s actions — as well as the networks it builds with other institutions and agents — are rooted in the idea that imagination must be stimulated so that new futures can be envisioned. Through its programs, laboratories, and debates, the institution spreads the conviction that the future is not predetermined — and that, in constant motion, it is possible to reinvent the ways of being in the world, interpreting it, and relating to people and nature.
