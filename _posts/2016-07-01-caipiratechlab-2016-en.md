This laboratory aims to stimulate the adoption of technologies of minimum environmental impact for the construction of new economies and structures of work.

In this activity we dealt with *Seed Economies* within the daily management of a farm and the broader political, economic and social implications.

In partnership with Sítio Bicho Solto, which is part of the Agroecological Association of Teresópolis, CaipiraTech Lab opened a program for an Agroecological experience in the rural area of Teresópolis between June 18 and 19, 2016.
