**LAB DE FERTILIZAÇÃO A BASE DE BIOFERTILIZANTES**  
ANDRES MAURICIO MONCAYO | Chachagüí, Nariño, Colombia.

![](/media/images/interactivos18/biofertilizantes.jpg)

Creation of a small laboratory for the cultivation of biofertilizers: liquid fertilizers with a lot of balanced energy and minerals prepared from fresh manure, dissolved in water and enriched with milk and molasses, fermented in plastic tanks, under an anaerobic system and enriched with mineral salts such as sulfates of magnesium, zinc, copper, etc. We also aim to manufacture Ajidol (which is an organic product that has insecticidal effects), Ash Broth (natural Fungicide), and develop efficient microorganisms to make manure tea and biostimulants with aloe vera.

**Profile for Collaborators:**  
People who work in the fields, coffee growers, people who have home gardens or other crops, professionals in agricultural technology, people who have knowledge in hydroponics.

**NGUARA - GUIDE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF ANIMAL AND HUMAN COVERINGS**  
DANIEL DA SILVA ALMEIDA, TOMMI EDNARDO COSTA e GABRIELA DI SESSA |  Resende, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.	

![](/media/images/interactivos18/bambu.jpg)

Elaboration of a manual outlining practical solutions for human settlements or animal shelters using ancestral techniques (such as Nguara Puris) and contemporary techniques (biodynamics, permaculture, syntropy) emphasizing the use of natural materials like bamboo. The goal is to compile technologies that may be useful in creating these shelters and group them together in a guide to encourage the use of sustainable technologies for the creation of rural human settlements. As a prototype we will develop something like a chicken coop and a small temporary shelter.
								
**Profile for Collaborators:** 
Production engineers or material engineers; Designers with experience in the use of natural material; Bioconstructors or architects with experience in the use of bamboo; Woodworkers; Representatives of ancestral communities (mainly Puri Indians); Permaculturists; Illustrators; Graphic designers; Content Editors; Photographers.

**FERMENTADOS _ COZINHA NÔMADE**
DANIELA SERRUYA KOHN | Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brasil

![](/media/images/interactivos18/fermentados.jpg)

Create a Food and Beverage Fermentation Station by exchanging experiments and techniques through the cultivation, care and observation of the microbiomes of the food in the fermentation process. Work with the transformation of surpluses of unconventional vegetables and herbs into medicinal foods and artisan probiotics . As a result we will make an online publication with recipes based on fermentation.
 
**Profile for Collaborators:**
Farmers, cooks, artists, carpenters, biologists, students, food engineers, Serrinha residents, illustrators, web designers, and others interested in research.

**ROTA-MNESIS**
ANA HENRIQUES BROTAS | Lisboa, Portugal

![](/media/images/interactivos18/mapas.jpg)

Since memories influence our perception of space, how is this process translated into a depiction?
   
Investigation of the intrinsic need to make and use maps in a rural iconographic reality, deeply intertwined with memory. Through a participatory and community-engaged methodology, this project intends to potentiate a pictorial language of spatial representation based on the empirical exploration of the local pedestrian routes.

 
**Profile for Collaborators:**  
People with experience or interest in a community and collaborative methodology. People with cartographic knowledge (technological-scientific notions); knowledge in the pictorial representation of space; knowledge of painting and drawing (of aesthetics, color, composition, techniques).
