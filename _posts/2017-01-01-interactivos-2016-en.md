Between October 29 and November 12, 2016, we hosted Interactivos?. Interactivos? is a collaborative laboratory for project development that proposes an interactive model of learning that surpasses the typical hierarchical dynamics established in the figures of teacher and student.

This year our theme was Water and Autonomy with the objective of creating an interaction between different areas that complement each other within the systemic dynamics of water, including a platform for the exchange of information and technologies on the conscious and sustainable management of water.

The five projects developed addressed issues on agroecology, sanitation, water conservation and monitoring using various tools, methodologies, knowledge bases and languages.
