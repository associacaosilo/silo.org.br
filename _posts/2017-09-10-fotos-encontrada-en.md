EncontrADA: Ancestral Technology and Knowledge, was a meeting that gathered people interested in issues related to the feminist and feminine universes of different generations and areas of interest.

We invited a wonderful team of women to host mentoring sessions for projects coordinated by women and a diverse and competent group of people to give workshops in: Autonomous Feminist networks; Self-defense; Woodwork; Automotive mechanics; Self-care; Agroforestry system; Natural Gynecology; Handling Medicinal Plants; and Embroidery. All the activities were free, while registration for the mentoring sessions and the workshops were done via a public call.
