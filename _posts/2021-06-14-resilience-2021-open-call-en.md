# Open Call
### Art and science

[Convocatoria en español](https://silo.org.br/resilience-2021-open-call-es/) <br>
[Chamada em português](https://silo.org.br/resilience-2021-open-call/)

By the means of this call, we invite artists, curators and scientists willing to work in Art and Science to apply for [Resilience: artist in residence](https://resilience.silo.org.br/en/){:target="_blank"} that will take place between  that will take place between **August 22 and September 12, 2021**.

This year, the residency will host artists, curators and scientists interested in developing their work in a rural space in exuberant nature. The Resilience: Artist Residency will take place outside science labs and art workshops, in the Atlantic Forest domain, in the Environmental Protection Area of Serrinha do Alambari and on the Itatiaia National Park's plateau, located at 2,791 meters of altitude.

In this environment, artists and curators intending to do research and willing to dialogue with science and scientific methods will have the opportunity to work alongside scientists. Scientists, in turn, will be able to expand their field of vision while dealing with unconventional variables, far from the protocols of their laboratories, and to link their work to artistic production.

The residency offers a favorable atmosphere for knowledge exchange between artists and scientists. We believe that science can transform itself by learning from artistic references, from the ways of thinking and doing which are intrinsic to art, on the one hand. On the other hand, we also believe that art can have an active voice in debates concerning scientific issues with great impact on society. Although they belong to different universes, using different languages and approaches, they both present creative processes and deal with the resolution of different problems. That said, artists and scientists can greatly benefit from a mutual sharing of experiences and perspectives, especially if they have the opportunity to share the same place for doing research and work. In this sense, by establishing connections between different knowledge and promoting dialogue between multiple actors, Resilience: Artistic Residency aims to promote closer bonds and a richer dialogue between science, art and society.   


The registration in the residency will be made exclusively per email: **contato@silo.org.br**. The subject of the email may include: **Registration - Resilience**. The email must contain a PDF file with:
