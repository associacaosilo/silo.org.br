**Places and Context**  
The residence will take place in the Environmental Protection Area of Serrinha do Alambari and Itatiaia National Park Plateau, both located in the Serra da Mantiqueira, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The spaces surrounding these two areas will also be available to carry out the works: environmental reserves, rural communities and the industrial centre.

The Serrinha do Alambari is an integral part of an Environmental Protected Area, situated in the municipal area of Resende (RJ), on the eastern slopes of Itatiaia National Park, Serra da Mantiqueira, to the west of the road to Visconde de Mauá (RJ-163). This area is peculiar for being a rural and environmental protection area. Serrinha has around 1,000 inhabitants, with small and medium-scale manufacture, commerce and tourism. The Environmental Protection Area of Serrinha do Alambari takes in the communities of Serrinha and Capelinha, protecting the high part of the micro basins of the Alambari and Pirapitinga rivers. Its total area is 4,500 hectares.

Itatiaia Plateau is located within the territory of Itatiaia National Park. The First Brazilian National Park was created in 1937 and is situated in the Serra da Mantiqueira. It is around 28 thousand hectares in size, covers Rio and Minas Gerais States and its terrain is characterized by mountains and rocky outcrops, with an altitude that ranges from 600 to 2,791 m, at its highest point, the ‘Black Needles Peak’ (Pico das Agulhas Negras). In the Itatiaia Plateau region, the highlands and U-shaped valleys are found. The park contains the sources of 12 important regional drainage basins, which drain into two main basins: that of the Grande river, an affluent of the Paraná river, and that of the Paraíba do Sul river, Rio de Janeiro’s most important river.

This conservation area is next to an industrial centre bordering the Paraíba do Sul river and the Presidente Dutra Highway, which connects the cities of Rio de Janeiro and San Paulo.
